title: "Movies Recommendation System: GroupLens Dataset"
excerpt: "Users usually consume a new product or service based on recommendations made by other users. This is clearly seen when deciding whether to watch or not to watch a movie. Companies such as Netflix use recommendation algorithms to predict how many stars a user will give a specific movie. Unfortunately, their data is not publicly available.
