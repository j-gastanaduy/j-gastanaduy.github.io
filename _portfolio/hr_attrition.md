title: "Algorithms to predict Employee Attrition"
excerpt: "It is well known that human capital is one of the main assets of any company, if not the most important one. For this reason, it is wise to lower the attrition rate as much as possible. To do this, we must first know who are the employees that are quitting and what are the variables which might be explaining this behavior. With this purpose in mind, we wanted to create an algorithm that could predict employee attrition. On this occasion, we worked with a fictional open dataset created by IBM data scientists."
