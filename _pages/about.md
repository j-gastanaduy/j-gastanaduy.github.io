Hi, I am Jesus! I hold a B.A. in Psychology, and currently work as a Behavioral Designer at [RIMAC Seguros](https://www.rimac.com/). 

I have previosuly worked as a Behavioral Researcher at [Heuristica Lab](https://www.heuristicalab.com/), and as a Research Assistant at the [Center for Healthy Minds](https://centerhealthyminds.org/).

I have more than 3 years of experience designing and evaluating experimental studies, as well as conducting quantitative and qualitative research for the private and public sector. 

My interests rely in using behavioral insights and quantitative analysis (econometrics and machine learning) to design and evaluate solutions, interventions and/or evidence-based policies.
