Hi, I am Jesus! I am currently studying a Master of Science in Business Analytics at UC San Diego, Rady School of Management; and hold a B.A. in Psychology from Pontifica Universidad Católica del Perú.

In the past I have had roles as Senior Design Researcher at [Interbank](https://interbank.pe/), CX Metrics & Analytics Specialist at [RIMAC Seguros](https://www.rimac.com/), Behavioral Designer at [RIMAC Seguros](https://www.rimac.com/), Behavioral Researcher at [Heuristica Lab](https://www.heuristicalab.com/), and Research Assistant at the [Center for Healthy Minds](https://centerhealthyminds.org/).

I have more than 5 years of experience designing and evaluating business experiments; developing statistical and machine learning models; as well as conducting quantitative and qualitative research for the financial industry. 

I am eager to help organizations make evidence-based decisions through the correct understanding of data and the promptly application of behavioral insights.

In my free time, I love doing gymnastics, playing the guitar, and from time to time having chess matches.
