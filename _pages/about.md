About me
======
Hi! I currently work as a behavioral designer at [RIMAC Seguros](https://www.rimac.com/). I have more than 3 years of experience designing and evaluating experimental studies, as well as conducting quantitative and qualitative research for the private and public sector. I am interested in using
behavioral insights and quantitative analysis (econometrics and machine learning) to design and evaluate solutions,
interventions and/or evidence-based policies.
