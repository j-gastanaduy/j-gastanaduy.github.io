Hi, I am Jesus! I hold a B.A. in Psychology, and a Diploma in Data Science. 

I currently work as a CX Metrics & Analytics Specialist at [RIMAC Seguros](https://www.rimac.com/); and in the past, have had roles as Behavioral Designer at [RIMAC Seguros](https://www.rimac.com/), Behavioral Researcher at [Heuristica Lab](https://www.heuristicalab.com/), and Research Assistant at the [Center for Healthy Minds](https://centerhealthyminds.org/).

I have more than 3 years of experience designing and evaluating business experiments, developing statistical and machine learning models, as well as conducting quantitative and qualitative research for the private and public sector. 

I am eager to help organizations make evidence-based decisions through the correct understanding of data and the promptly application of behavioral insights.
