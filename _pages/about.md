Hi, I am Jesus! I hold a B.A. in Psychology, and currently work as a CX Metrics & Analytics Specialist at [RIMAC Seguros](https://www.rimac.com/). 

I have previosuly worked as a Behavioral Designer at [RIMAC Seguros](https://www.rimac.com/), Behavioral Researcher at [Heuristica Lab](https://www.heuristicalab.com/), and as a Research Assistant at the [Center for Healthy Minds](https://centerhealthyminds.org/).

I have more than 3 years of experience designing and evaluating experimental studies, as well as conducting quantitative and qualitative research for the private and public sector. 

My interests rely in using behavioral insights, causal inference and machine learning models to design and evaluate business solutions, as well as evidence-based policies.
